# RiichiCityTournamentBot
Manages a lot of the headache of running a tourney in Riichi City. Accesses the API and Discord's API.


My !readme isn't exactly super great/maybe out of date... Since that was Klorofin's read me...
I'll maybe update it. Just know you should look at the config file first then the requests folder.

After that go to index.js and start digging, you'll mainly use requests, riichicitybot, and discordbot
